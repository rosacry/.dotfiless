until my hold is released august 20th, if there is any spots open for either cse 220 or cse 216, take it first semester with swaping out a class on the schedule.

if this is not possible.. then we take cse 215 and 216 second semester, while taking cse 220 over the summer

if you can only take one of the two classes second semester.. then take the other two summer 1 and summer 2 of next year

goal: finish all introductory cse classes before the start of sophmore year
